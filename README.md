# InternIntelligence_MovieAPI
This project is developed as part of my internship at Intern Intelligence. It is a RESTful API built using Java Spring Boot for managing a movie database. The API supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and is documented using Swagger for easy testing and integration.
